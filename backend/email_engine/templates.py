Dear {{author_name}},

I recently read {{book_title}} and was deeply impressed by your philosophy on {{philosophy}}. It specifically resonated with how we approach systems design at The Build Club.

Your principle of "{{principles}}" is something I often discuss with fellow founders.

I host "The Build Club Conversations", a podcast for technical founders. I would be honored to host you for a brief session to discuss {{opportunities}}.

Best regards,

Mohit Silla
Founder, The Build Club

FRIENDLY_TEMPLATE = """Subject: Loved {{book_title}} - Quick question for {{author_name}}

Hi {{author_name}},

Just finished reading {{book_title}}. Your take on {{philosophy}} is spot on!

I'm building a community called The Build Club for founders who code. I think your ideas on {{principles}} would be super valuable to our members.

Any chance you'd be open to a 15-min chat or a podcast spot?

Cheers,

Mohit

PODCAST_TEMPLATE = """Subject: Invitation to share your founder journey on a podcast

Hi {{author_name}},

I hope you’re doing well. I’m Mohit Silla — an early-stage founder and entrepreneur, and I also run a small podcast called *The Build Club Conversations* on YouTube.

I’ve been following your journey, especially {{context}}, and I genuinely admire what you’ve built and the depth of experience you bring as a founder.

I’m reaching out to learn.

I host long-form conversations with experienced entrepreneurs to understand the real story behind building companies — the early decisions, the hard trade-offs, the failures, the pivots, and what actually compounds over time. As someone still early in my journey, these insights are incredibly valuable to me and to other young founders.

If you’d be open to it, I’d love to invite you for a 60-minute podcast conversation over Google Meet. The session would be published on my YouTube channel (currently ~300 subscribers, growing steadily) and focused purely on your journey, lessons, and perspective — no promotions or sales angle.

If this sounds interesting, I’d be happy to work around your schedule.

Thank you for your time, and regardless, I appreciate the work you’ve done and the example you’ve set for founders like me.

Warm regards,
Mohit Silla
Founder, The Build Club Conversations
