# Hyper-Personalized Outreach Emails - Build Club Conversations

**Subject:** The quiet revolution you started at 37signals

Hi Jason,

I hope this finds you well. I'm Mohit Silla — an early-stage founder navigating the chaotic early days of building, and I run a small podcast called *The Build Club Conversations* on YouTube.

I've been studying your work for a while now, particularly your philosophy on calm companies and the principles you outlined in *Rework*. In a world that glorifies hustle culture and growth-at-all-costs, your contrarian stance on building a deliberately small, profitable, and sustainable business has been both refreshing and inspiring.

What strikes me most is that you didn't just write about these ideas — you lived them. Building Basecamp into a thriving company without VC funding, while maintaining work-life balance and refusing to play the exit game, is a masterclass in entrepreneurial conviction.

I'm reaching out because I'm deeply curious about the decision-making behind this path. How did you resist the pressure to scale aggressively? What were the trade-offs that nobody talks about? And how do you think about company building in an era where "disruption" and "unicorns" dominate the narrative?

I host long-form conversations with experienced entrepreneurs to understand the real story behind building companies — not the polished LinkedIn version, but the messy truth. As someone still early in my journey, learning from founders who've built on their own terms is invaluable.

If you'd be open to it, I'd love to invite you for a 60-minute conversation over Google Meet. It would be published on my YouTube channel (currently ~300 subscribers, growing steadily) and focused purely on your journey, principles, and what you've learned from building 37signals — no promotions, no fluff.

I'd be honored to work around your schedule if this sounds interesting.

Thank you for your time, Jason, and for consistently challenging the startup orthodoxy. Your work has influenced how I think about building.

Warm regards,  
Mohit Silla  
Founder, The Build Club Conversations

Hi Jason,

I'm Mohit — an early-stage founder running *The Build Club Conversations* podcast on YouTube.

Your philosophy on calm companies and the principles in *Rework* have fundamentally shaped how I think about building. In a world obsessed with hockey-stick growth, your contrarian approach to staying small, profitable, and sustainable is both rare and inspiring.

I'm curious about the untold story behind these decisions. I host long-form conversations with experienced founders to explore the real trade-offs, failures, and convictions that shaped their companies.

Would you be open to a 60-min conversation over Google Meet? Happy to work around your schedule.

Thanks for building on your own terms.

**Subject:** Rails, remote work, and refusing to compromise

Hi David,

I hope you're doing well. I'm Mohit Silla — an early-stage founder and the host of *The Build Club Conversations*, a podcast where I sit down with experienced entrepreneurs to learn how they actually built their companies.

I've followed your work for years — from creating Ruby on Rails (which literally changed how we build software) to your outspoken critiques of big tech monopolies and your relentless advocacy for remote work and sustainable business practices.

What fascinates me most is your intellectual honesty. You don't just build products; you actively challenge industry norms, whether it's calling out surveillance capitalism, defending privacy, or arguing for keeping companies small and independent. That takes conviction, and I imagine it's come with its own set of trade-offs.

I'm reaching out because I want to understand the story beneath the strong opinions. What was it like building Basecamp outside Silicon Valley's echo chamber? How do you balance being a provocateur with being a builder? And what lessons from Rails have shaped how you think about product development and company culture?

I host 60-minute conversations with founders who've done meaningful work — the kind of work that lasts. These aren't promotional interviews; they're deep dives into the craft of building, the hard decisions, and the long game.

If you'd be open to it, I'd love to have you on the podcast. We'd record over Google Meet, and it would be published on YouTube (~300 subscribers, growing steadily). Purely focused on your journey and insights — no agenda beyond learning from you.

I'd be honored to work around your schedule.

Thank you for your time, David, and for consistently building and speaking from first principles.

Warm regards,  
Mohit Silla

**Subject:** Staying small by choice — not by circumstance

Hi Paul,

I hope this finds you well. I'm Mohit Silla — an early-stage founder and host of *The Build Club Conversations*, a podcast where I explore the real stories behind how companies get built.

Your concept of "Company of One" hit me at exactly the right time. In a world that equates growth with success, your deliberate decision to stay small and profitable — and to treat that as a feature, not a bug — is quietly revolutionary.

What resonates most is that this isn't a philosophy born from limitation; it's a conscious choice backed by experience. You've built Fathom Analytics into a privacy-first alternative to Google Analytics while staying independent, profitable, and intentionally small. That's rare, and I imagine it required saying "no" to a lot of conventional advice.

I'm reaching out because I want to understand the journey behind these convictions. How did you arrive at the realization that staying small was the right path? What were the moments where you questioned it? And how do you think about impact and legacy when you're deliberately not chasing scale?

I host 60-minute conversations with founders who think differently about building. These aren't PR interviews — they're explorations of the messy, non-linear path of entrepreneurship.

If you'd be open to it, I'd love to invite you for a conversation over Google Meet. It would be published on YouTube (~300 subscribers, growing steadily), focused purely on your journey and the lessons you've learned.

I'd be happy to work around your schedule.

Thank you for your time, Paul, and for proving that "small" can be a strategy, not a compromise.

Warm regards,

**Subject:** From Lean Canvas to systematic scaling

Hi Ash,

I hope you're doing well. I'm Mohit Silla — an early-stage founder and host of *The Build Club Conversations*, where I sit down with experienced entrepreneurs to understand the real story behind building companies.

The Lean Canvas has been a foundational tool for me (and thousands of other founders). What I admire most is that you took abstract concepts from Lean Startup and made them actionable. You gave early-stage founders a clear, repeatable framework for thinking through their business — and that's had real impact.

But what I'm most curious about is the journey beyond the framework. Your work on *Running Lean* and *Scaling Lean* suggests you've spent years thinking about what comes after product-market fit — the hard, unglamorous work of systematic scaling and continuous validation.

I'm reaching out because I want to learn from your experience. How do you balance the rigor of frameworks with the chaos of real-world building? What have you learned from watching thousands of founders apply (and misapply) Lean Canvas? And how has your thinking evolved since you first published *Running Lean*?

I host 60-minute conversations with founders who've done deep work in their domain. These aren't surface-level interviews — they're explorations of the craft, the failures, and the lessons that only come from doing the work.

If you'd be open to it, I'd love to have you on the podcast. We'd record over Google Meet and publish on YouTube (~300 subscribers, growing steadily). Purely focused on your journey and insights — no sales pitch, just learning.

I'd be honored to work around your schedule.

Thank you for your time, Ash, and for giving founders a language to think clearly about their businesses.

**Subject:** From building hooks to breaking them

Hi Nir,

I hope this finds you well. I'm Mohit Silla — an early-stage founder and host of *The Build Club Conversations*, a podcast where I explore how experienced entrepreneurs think about building products and companies.

Your work has had a profound influence on how I think about product design. *Hooked* laid bare the psychology behind habit-forming products, giving product builders a powerful (and potentially dangerous) toolkit. But what fascinates me most is how you've evolved from studying how to build hooks to studying how to break them with *Indistractable*.

That progression feels deeply honest — and rare. You didn't just move on to the next trend; you confronted the implications of your own work and explored the flip side: how do we protect our attention in a world designed to capture it?

I'm reaching out because I'm curious about that evolution. What changed in your thinking between *Hooked* and *Indistractable*? How do you reconcile creating tools for engagement with advocating for digital well-being? And what advice would you give founders building consumer products today?

I host 60-minute conversations with founders and thinkers who've done meaningful work. These aren't promotional interviews — they're deep explorations of the craft, the ethics, and the lessons learned along the way.

If you'd be open to it, I'd love to invite you for a conversation over Google Meet. It would be published on YouTube (~300 subscribers, growing steadily), focused purely on your journey and insights.

I'd be happy to work around your schedule.

Thank you for your time, Nir, and for evolving your thinking in public.

**Subject:** Bridging the gap between strategy and design

Hi Marty,

I hope you're doing well. I'm Mohit Silla — an early-stage founder and host of *The Build Club Conversations*, where I sit down with experienced entrepreneurs and thinkers to understand how they approach their craft.

Your work on branding, particularly *The Brand Gap*, fundamentally changed how I think about the relationship between business strategy and design. The idea that the gap between them is where value gets lost — and where great brands are made — is something I've returned to again and again.

What strikes me most is how you've articulated the messy, intuitive work of branding in a way that actually helps practitioners. You didn't just theorize; you gave people a framework to close that gap in their own companies.

I'm reaching out because I want to understand your journey and thinking. How did you develop this synthesis between strategy and design? What patterns have you seen in companies that successfully bridge the gap versus those that don't? And how has your thinking on branding evolved over the years?

I host 60-minute conversations with people who've done deep work in their domain. These aren't surface-level interviews — they're explorations of craft, experience, and the lessons that only come from doing the work.

If you'd be open to it, I'd love to have you on the podcast. We'd record over Google Meet and publish on YouTube (~300 subscribers, growing steadily). Purely focused on your insights and journey — no agenda beyond learning from you.

I'd be honored to work around your schedule.

Thank you for your time, Marty, and for giving designers and strategists a common language.

## 7. Lou Downe (School of Good Services)

### Full Email
**Subject:** The principles behind good services

Hi Lou,

I hope this finds you well. I'm Mohit Silla — an early-stage founder and host of *The Build Club Conversations*, a podcast where I explore how experienced practitioners think about design, systems, and building for people.

Your work on service design, particularly the principles you outlined in *Good Services*, has been eye-opening for me. Coming from a background as Design Director of the UK Government, you've seen service design at massive scale — and you've distilled that experience into actionable principles.

What resonates most is how you've made the invisible visible. Services are everywhere, yet we rarely think about them systematically. Your framework gives founders and designers a way to think clearly about the end-to-end experience, not just the interface.

I'm reaching out because I'm curious about the journey behind these insights. How did your time in government shape your thinking on service design? What patterns do you see in services that work versus those that don't? And what advice would you give founders thinking about services, not just products?

I host 60-minute conversations with people who've done meaningful work in their field. These aren't PR interviews — they're deep explorations of craft, experience, and lessons learned.

If you'd be open to it, I'd love to invite you for a conversation over Google Meet. It would be published on YouTube (~300 subscribers, growing steadily), focused purely on your journey and insights.

I'd be happy to work around your schedule.

Thank you for your time, Lou, and for making service design accessible to practitioners.

## 8. April Dunford (Ambient Strategy)

**Subject:** Positioning as a strategic superpower

Hi April,

I hope you're doing well. I'm Mohit Silla — an early-stage founder and host of *The Build Club Conversations*, where I sit down with experienced entrepreneurs to understand the craft behind building companies.

Your work on positioning, especially *Obviously Awesome*, has been transformative for how I think about go-to-market strategy. The idea that positioning isn't messaging — it's the strategic foundation that everything else builds on — completely reframed how I approach product communication.

What strikes me most is how you've taken years of B2B positioning expertise and made it actionable for founders. You didn't just identify the problem; you gave us a systematic framework to solve it.

I'm reaching out because I want to understand the journey behind your expertise. How did you recognize that positioning was the missing piece in so many B2B failures? What patterns do you see in companies that nail positioning versus those that struggle? And how should early-stage founders think about positioning when the product is still evolving?

I host 60-minute conversations with founders and operators who've mastered their craft. These aren't surface-level interviews — they're explorations of the hard-won lessons and strategic thinking that comes from doing the work.

If you'd be open to it, I'd love to have you on the podcast. We'd record over Google Meet and publish on YouTube (~300 subscribers, growing steadily). Purely focused on your journey and insights — no promotions, just learning.

I'd be honored to work around your schedule.

Thank you for your time, April, and for giving B2B founders a competitive edge.

## 9. Michele Hansen (Geocodio)

**Subject:** Customer research as a founder's superpower

Hi Michele,

I hope this finds you well. I'm Mohit Silla — an early-stage founder and host of *The Build Club Conversations*, a podcast where I explore how experienced founders approach building and understanding their customers.

Your work on customer research, particularly the framework you shared in *Deploy Empathy*, has changed how I think about talking to users. You showed that customer research isn't just for big companies with dedicated teams — it's a learnable skill that founders can (and should) master.

What I admire most is how you've built Geocodio while practicing these principles in real-time. It's one thing to write about customer empathy; it's another to live it while bootstrapping a profitable SaaS business.

I'm reaching out because I want to understand how you developed this approach. How do you balance the rigor of good research with the scrappiness of being a founder? What have you learned from thousands of customer conversations? And how has empathy shaped not just your product, but your entire business?

I host 60-minute conversations with founders who've built something real. These aren't promotional interviews — they're explorations of the craft, the mistakes, and the hard-won insights that shape how we build.

If you'd be open to it, I'd love to invite you for a conversation over Google Meet. It would be published on YouTube (~300 subscribers, growing steadily), focused purely on your journey and what you've learned.

I'd be happy to work around your schedule.

Thank you for your time, Michele, and for making customer research accessible to founders like me.

### Full Email
**Subject:** Life profitability and second acts

Hi Adii,

I hope you're doing well. I'm Mohit Silla — an early-stage founder and host of *The Build Club Conversations*, where I sit down with experienced entrepreneurs to understand the real story behind building companies.

Your journey is uniquely fascinating to me. Building WooCommerce, selling it, and then starting Cogsy shows a rare kind of entrepreneurial maturity. But what resonates most is your writing on "life profitability" — the idea that success isn't just financial returns, but how we structure our lives and work.

That's a hard-won perspective. It's easy to chase the next exit or the next milestone. It's much harder to step back and ask: what kind of life do I actually want to build alongside this business?

I'm reaching out because I want to understand how you arrived at this philosophy. What did you learn from the WooCommerce experience that shaped how you're building Cogsy? How do you think about balance and sustainability as a second-time founder? And what advice would you give founders navigating their first exit and contemplating what comes next?

I host 60-minute conversations with founders who've done meaningful work and thought deeply about what it means to build well. These aren't PR interviews — they're explorations of the journey, the trade-offs, and the lessons learned.

If you'd be open to it, I'd love to have you on the podcast. We'd record over Google Meet and publish on YouTube (~300 subscribers, growing steadily). Purely focused on your story and insights.

I'd be honored to work around your schedule.

Thank you for your time, Adii, and for writing honestly about what building a life, not just a company, looks like.

## 11. Gabriel Weinberg (DuckDuckGo)

### Full Email
**Subject:** Traction, privacy, and playing the long game

Hi Gabriel,

I hope this finds you well. I'm Mohit Silla — an early-stage founder and host of *The Build Club Conversations*, a podcast where I explore how experienced entrepreneurs build and scale companies.

You've done something rare: you co-authored *Traction*, which became a foundational text for startup growth, and you've built DuckDuckGo into a real alternative to Google in the search space — a market most people said was impossible to compete in.

What fascinates me most is the conviction behind DuckDuckGo. Building a privacy-focused search engine requires playing a very long game in a market dominated by a trillion-dollar monopoly. That takes a special kind of clarity about what you're building and why.

I'm reaching out because I want to understand that journey. How did you validate that there was real demand for privacy before it became mainstream? What were the moments where you questioned whether DuckDuckGo would work? And how do you think about growth and traction when you're building in a category that didn't exist?

I host 60-minute conversations with founders who've played the long game. These aren't surface-level interviews — they're explorations of the strategic thinking, the setbacks, and the conviction required to build something lasting.

If you'd be open to it, I'd love to have you on the podcast. We'd record over Google Meet and publish on YouTube (~300 subscribers, growing steadily). Purely focused on your journey with DuckDuckGo and the lessons from co-authoring *Traction*.

I'd be happy to work around your schedule.

Thank you for your time, Gabriel, and for proving that principled companies can compete — and win.

**Subject:** From Traction to bone broth — and back

Hi Justin,

I hope you're doing well. I'm Mohit Silla — an early-stage founder and host of *The Build Club Conversations*, where I sit down with experienced entrepreneurs to understand how they've navigated building companies.

Your journey is uniquely interesting. Co-authoring *Traction* gave thousands of founders a playbook for growth, and then you went and applied those principles to build Kettle & Fire and Perfect Keto in the D2C space — entirely different from advising startups.

What strikes me most is that you didn't just theorize about traction channels; you stress-tested them in the messy reality of consumer brands, supply chains, and Amazon competition. That's rare credibility.

I'm reaching out because I want to understand how that experience shaped your thinking. What did you learn from building D2C brands that surprised you? How did the *Traction* framework hold up in practice? And what advice would you give founders trying to stand out in crowded consumer categories today?

I host 60-minute conversations with founders who've built across multiple domains. These aren't promotional interviews — they're explorations of the craft, the failures, and the hard-won lessons that shape how we think about growth.

If you'd be open to it, I'd love to have you on the podcast. We'd record over Google Meet and publish on YouTube (~300 subscribers, growing steadily). Purely focused on your journey and insights.

I'd be honored to work around your schedule.

Thank you for your time, Justin, and for stress-testing your own frameworks in the real world.

**Subject:** From Lean Startup to reimagining public markets

Hi Eric,

I hope this finds you well. I'm Mohit Silla — an early-stage founder and host of *The Build Club Conversations*, a podcast where I explore how experienced entrepreneurs think about building and systems change.

*The Lean Startup* fundamentally changed how an entire generation builds companies. The ideas of validated learning, build-measure-learn, and minimum viable product are now so embedded in startup culture that it's easy to forget how revolutionary they were.

But what fascinates me most is what you're doing now with the Long-Term Stock Exchange. You're not just helping founders build better companies — you're trying to change the structural incentives of public markets themselves. That's a different level of ambition.

I'm reaching out because I want to understand that evolution. What led you from teaching founders to launch products to trying to reform capitalism itself? How do you think about systems-level change versus product-level change? And what have you learned from building LTSE that informs how you now think about startups?

I host 60-minute conversations with founders who've done transformative work. These aren't PR interviews — they're explorations of the thinking, the setbacks, and the long-term vision behind building something that matters.

If you'd be open to it, I'd love to have you on the podcast. We'd record over Google Meet and publish on YouTube (~300 subscribers, growing steadily). Purely focused on your journey and what you've learned.

**Subject:** The psychological toll nobody talks about

Hi Ben,

I hope you're doing well. I'm Mohit Silla — an early-stage founder and host of *The Build Club Conversations*, where I sit down with experienced entrepreneurs to understand the real, unvarnished story behind building companies.

*The Hard Thing About Hard Things* was one of the first business books that felt honest. You didn't sugarcoat the psychological toll of leadership, the loneliness of hard decisions, or the reality that most startup advice doesn't apply when things are falling apart.

That honesty matters. As a founder navigating the early days, the polished narratives on LinkedIn feel disconnected from reality. Your book was a reminder that everyone struggles — the question is how you respond.

I'm reaching out because I want to understand the journey behind those lessons. What were the moments at Opsware where you questioned everything? How did you develop the resilience to keep going? And now as an investor, what patterns do you see in founders who navigate the hard things well versus those who don't?

I host 60-minute conversations with founders and investors who've been through it. These aren't surface-level interviews — they're explorations of the craft, the psychology, and the hard-won wisdom that comes from doing the work.

If you'd be open to it, I'd love to have you on the podcast. We'd record over Google Meet and publish on YouTube (~300 subscribers, growing steadily). Purely focused on your journey and insights — no agenda beyond learning from you.

I'd be honored to work around your schedule.

Thank you for your time, Ben, and for writing honestly about what it actually takes.

### Full Email
**Subject:** The stories behind the stories

Hi Jessica,

I hope this finds you well. I'm Mohit Silla — an early-stage founder and host of *The Build Club Conversations*, a podcast where I explore how experienced entrepreneurs built their companies.

*Founders at Work* is one of my favorite books. You interviewed some of the most influential founders of our time and captured their stories in a way that felt real — not the polished PR version, but the actual journey with all its messiness.

What strikes me most is how you co-founded Y Combinator and shaped the early-stage funding model that's now the gold standard. You've been in the room for thousands of founder stories, watching patterns emerge, seeing what works and what doesn't.

I'm reaching out because I want to understand what you've learned from that unique vantage point. What patterns do you see in founders who succeed versus those who struggle? How has your thinking on early-stage companies evolved over the years? And what advice would you give founders starting today that might contradict conventional wisdom?

I host 60-minute conversations with people who've shaped how we think about startups. These aren't PR interviews — they're deep explorations of experience, pattern recognition, and the lessons that only come from seeing hundreds of founding journeys unfold.

If you'd be open to it, I'd love to have you on the podcast. We'd record over Google Meet and publish on YouTube (~300 subscribers, growing steadily). Purely focused on your insights and what you've learned from YC.

I'd be honored to work around your schedule.

Thank you for your time, Jessica, and for capturing the real founder stories.

Warm regards,  
Mohit Silla

Hi Jessica,

I'm Mohit — host of *The Build Club Conversations* podcast.

*Founders at Work* captured the real stories, not the PR version. And through YC, you've seen thousands of founding journeys unfold.

I'm curious about the patterns you've observed and how your thinking has evolved. I host long-form conversations with people who've shaped how we think about startups.

Would you be open to a 60-min conversation over Google Meet?

Thanks for the real stories.

— Mohit

**Subject:** Freedom, micro-businesses, and the $100 startup

Hi Chris,

I hope you're doing well. I'm Mohit Silla — an early-stage founder and host of *The Build Club Conversations*, where I sit down with unconventional entrepreneurs to understand how they've built businesses on their own terms.

*The $100 Startup* opened my eyes to a different kind of entrepreneurship. You showed that you don't need VC funding, a perfect business plan, or even a big idea — you just need to start, learn, and iterate with what you have.

What resonates most is the freedom-first philosophy. You didn't just write about micro-businesses; you lived it — traveling to every country, building multiple ventures, and consistently choosing autonomy over scale.

I'm reaching out because I want to understand the philosophy behind that path. How do you think about "enough" in a world that constantly pushes for more? What patterns did you see in the successful $100 startups you profiled? And what advice would you give founders who want to build for freedom, not just exits?

I host 60-minute conversations with entrepreneurs who think differently about success. These aren't promotional interviews — they're explorations of the values, trade-offs, and lessons that shape how we build.

If you'd be open to it, I'd love to have you on the podcast. We'd record over Google Meet and publish on YouTube (~300 subscribers, growing steadily). Purely focused on your journey and insights.

I'd be happy to work around your schedule.

Thank you for your time, Chris, and for showing that there's more than one way to build.

Warm regards,

Hi Chris,

I'm Mohit — host of *The Build Club Conversations* podcast.

*The $100 Startup* showed a different path: you don't need funding or a perfect plan. Your freedom-first philosophy — traveling, building, choosing autonomy over scale — is rare.

I'm curious about how you think about "enough" and building for freedom. I host conversations with entrepreneurs who think differently.

Would you be open to a 60-min conversation over Google Meet?

Thanks for the alternative path.

**Subject:** The unscripted truth about wealth creation

Hi MJ,

I hope this finds you well. I'm Mohit Silla — an early-stage founder and host of *The Build Club Conversations*, a podcast where I explore how experienced entrepreneurs built their companies and created wealth.

*The Millionaire Fastlane* was a wake-up call. You cut through the conventional "save and invest for 40 years" advice and laid out an unvarnished truth: real wealth comes from building businesses that create value at scale, not from following the traditional script.

What I appreciate most is your intellectual honesty. Building and selling Limos.com gave you the credibility to speak from experience, not theory. You didn't just talk about the fastlane — you lived it, succeeded, and then came back to teach.

I'm reaching out because I want to understand the journey behind those convictions. What were the pivotal moments in building Limos.com that shaped your philosophy? How do you think about risk and execution in a way that's different from conventional wisdom? And what advice would you give founders who are trying to build real wealth, not just lifestyle businesses?

I host 60-minute conversations with founders who've done it and thought deeply about what it takes. These aren't surface-level interviews — they're explorations of the mindset, the execution, and the hard truths that most people won't talk about.

If you'd be open to it, I'd love to have you on the podcast. We'd record over Google Meet and publish on YouTube (~300 subscribers, growing steadily). Purely focused on your story and what you've learned.

I'd be honored to work around your schedule.

Thank you for your time, MJ, and for the unscripted truth.

**Subject:** Launch fast, learn faster

Hi Dan,

I hope you're doing well. I'm Mohit Silla — an early-stage founder and host of *The Build Club Conversations*, where I sit down with experienced entrepreneurs to understand how they built and scaled their companies.

*The 7 Day Startup* fundamentally changed how I think about launching. You took the intimidating process of starting a business and distilled it down to a simple, actionable framework: validate an idea in 7 days and launch immediately.

What I admire most is that you didn't just write about speed — you lived it. Building WP Curve to acquisition by GoDaddy proved that launching quickly and iterating beats endless planning.

I'm reaching out because I want to understand the story behind that philosophy. What led you to embrace speed as a core principle? What were the moments with WP Curve where you questioned this approach? And what advice would you give founders who are stuck in analysis paralysis?

I host 60-minute conversations with founders who've built something real. These aren't promotional interviews — they're explorations of the mindset, the failures, and the lessons learned from executing fast.

If you'd be open to it, I'd love to have you on the podcast. We'd record over Google Meet and publish on YouTube (~300 subscribers, growing steadily). Purely focused on your journey and insights.

I'd be happy to work around your schedule.

Thank you for your time, Dan, and for proving that action beats perfection.

**Subject:** Making marketing simple (and actionable)

Hi Allan,

I hope this finds you well. I'm Mohit Silla — an early-stage founder and host of *The Build Club Conversations*, a podcast where I explore how experienced entrepreneurs think about marketing and growth.

*The 1-Page Marketing Plan* is one of the most practical business books I've read. You took the overwhelming complexity of marketing and distilled it into a simple, one-page framework that founders can actually use.

What strikes me most is how you've focused on making marketing accessible to small business owners who don't have big budgets or dedicated teams. That clarity is rare and valuable.

I'm reaching out because I want to understand how you developed this approach. What patterns did you see in your work as a serial entrepreneur and marketer that led to this framework? How do you balance simplicity with effectiveness? And what advice would you give founders who are overwhelmed by all the marketing channels and tactics out there?

I host 60-minute conversations with entrepreneurs who've simplified complex domains. These aren't surface-level interviews — they're explorations of the thinking, the experience, and the lessons that come from doing the work.

If you'd be open to it, I'd love to have you on the podcast. We'd record over Google Meet and publish on YouTube (~300 subscribers, growing steadily). Purely focused on your journey and insights.

I'd be happy to work around your schedule.

Thank you for your time, Allan, and for making marketing accessible.

**Subject:** Irresistible offers and scaling with conviction

Hi Alex,

I hope you're doing well. I'm Mohit Silla — an early-stage founder and host of *The Build Club Conversations*, where I sit down with experienced entrepreneurs to understand how they've scaled businesses.

Your work on offers, particularly the framework in *$100M Offers*, has been transformative for how I think about value creation. The idea that the offer is the strategic foundation — not the marketing, not the branding — completely reframed how I approach positioning.

What I admire most is your track record. Building and scaling GymLaunch and Acquisition.com while practicing these principles in real-time gives your advice rare credibility. You're not a theorist — you're a practitioner who's proven the frameworks work.

I'm reaching out because I want to understand the journey behind your expertise. How did you develop the conviction that offers are the key unlock for scaling? What were the pivotal moments in building GymLaunch that shaped your thinking? And what advice would you give founders trying to stand out in commoditized markets?

I host 60-minute conversations with founders who've scaled real businesses. These aren't promotional interviews — they're explorations of the strategic thinking, the execution, and the hard-won lessons that come from building at scale.

If you'd be open to it, I'd love to have you on the podcast. We'd record over Google Meet and publish on YouTube (~300 subscribers, growing steadily). Purely focused on your journey and what you've learned.

I'd be honored to work around your schedule.

Thank you for your time, Alex, and for proving that great offers win.
