Bootstrapped the SaaS with his partner Danielle to $55k MRR in just two years. Known for his transparent 'Open Startup' metrics. Sold the business to a private equity firm in 2019 for a life-changing sum (undisclosed, est. low 7-figures). After the exit, he pivoted to becoming a full-time creator and educator, writing 'Zero to Sold' and 'The Embedded Entrepreneur'. He now runs a podcast and newsletter helping other developers build sustainable bootstrapped businesses without burnout. A true engineer-turned-writer who advocates for 'calm' entrepreneurship." },

Initially struggled with a SaaS product (getting only $100 MRR) but pivoted to info-products. Wrote 'The Good Parts of AWS', which generated $100k+ in sales quickly. Then launched 'Small Bets', a community teaching a portfolio approach to entrepreneurship, which now generates $1M+ in revenue. He advocates for avoiding 'big bang' startup failures and instead taking multiple small, asymmetric bets. Living proof that you can leave Big Tech and thrive on your own terms." },

He now runs a portfolio of one-person AI startups (including PhotoAI and InteriorAI) generating over $3M/year with 0 employees and 0 funding. His book 'Make' is the bible for shipping fast. He lives out of a backpack, traveling the world while coding. A controversial but undeniably brilliant figure in the solopreneur space." },

He quit to become a solopreneur and built a one-person business to $5M+ in revenue with 94% margins. Famous for his 'LinkedIn Operating System' course, which teaches others how to build a massive personal brand. He treats his content like a product, posting daily to his 500k+ followers. He advocates for 'diversified solopreneurship'—consulting, courses, and newsletters. He lives a quiet life in upstate New York, proving you don't need to be in SF to win." },

His story is a rollercoaster: he raised $8M from top VCs (Kleiner Perkins) to build the next billion-dollar unicorn, but growth stalled. He had to lay off almost his entire team and buy back his company from investors for pennies on the dollar. He rebuilt Gumroad as a profitable, remote-first, 'calm' company that now processes hundreds of millions for creators. His book 'The Minimalist Entrepreneur' argues for starting businesses that make money from day one, rather than chasing growth at all costs." },

He wrote 'Lost and Founder', a brutally honest memoir exposing the dark side of the VC-backed startup world. He then founded SparkToro, an audience intelligence tool, with a unique funding model (LLC structure, profit-sharing) designed to avoid the 'growth trap'. He is a vocal critic of the 'growth at all costs' mentality and advocates for 'chill work'. A legend in the SEO and marketing world." },

He bootstrapped the company through years of slow growth before it exploded. Today, it does $35M+ ARR and is one of the most respected bootstrapped companies in the world. He writes about 'The Ladders of Wealth Creation' and investing in creators. He recently bought a ghost town in Idaho to turn it into a creator campus." },

His podcast 'Startups for the Rest of Us' has over 600 episodes. His book 'Start Small, Stay Small' was one of the first guides to niche software entrepreneurship." },

Stripe acquired the site just 6 months after launch to support the startup ecosystem. He continues to run the podcast, which is a primary source of inspiration for thousands of founders.

Starter Story is now one of the biggest resources for finding business ideas, with millions of monthly visitors. A prime example of content-led bootstrapping." },
